= Target configuration file

Target configuration files are located in the `target/` subdirectory of the configuration directory.
They describe the hardware of the machine being tested.

It must have one section per switch chip.
Each indexed switch section must describe the switch model and its enabled links.

A target featuring two interconnected switch chips is described as follow:

.router.cfg
[source,ini]
----
[switch0] ; <1>
name = "foo-etherswitch" ; <2>
port0 = link0
port1 = link1
port2 = link2
port3 = link3

[switch1]
name = "foo-etherswitch"
port0 = link4
port1 = link5 ; <3>
port2 = link6
----
<1> Switch section indexed from 0
<2> Refers to a `foo-etherswitch.cfg` switch configuration file
<3> Local switch port to global _link_ mapping
